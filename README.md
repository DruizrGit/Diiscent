# Diiscent : Descent Dice Probability Generator

This is a GUI made with the Python Tkinter library for the 'Descent' board game. 

In Descent, you use dice to determine the outcome of in-game events such as damage dealt, attack range or the result of a skill check. The motivation for this project was that I wanted to systematically assess any in-game situation to determine what the odds of success are (without having to bring out the pen and paper).

The GUI displays matplotlib generated probability graphs for the selected 'attack dice' and 'defense dice' pools.
